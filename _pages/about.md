I am currently a third-year PhD student at Pennsylvania State University. I am fortunate to be advised by [Dr. Jinyuan Jia](https://jinyuan-jia.github.io/). My research focuses on AI Security & Trustworthy ML, recently focusing on LLM robustness and transparency. Previously, I earned double bachelor’s degrees in Mechanical Engineering and Computer Science from RPI, followed by a master’s in Computer Science from Duke University.

## Current research focuses
* Transparency of LLM-empowered AI systems for security purposes
* Enhancing the efficiency of optimization-based LLM red-teaming
* Provably secure/robust machine learning systems

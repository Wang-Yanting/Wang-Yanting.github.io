I am currently a second-year PhD student at Pennsylvania State University. I am fortunate to be advised by [Dr. Jinyuan Jia](https://jinyuan-jia.github.io/). My research focuses on AI Security & Trustworthy ML, recently focusing on LLM explanation. Previously, I earned dual bachelor’s degrees in Mechanical Engineering and Computer Science from RPI, followed by a master’s in Computer Science from Duke University.


## Current research focuses

* Transparency of LLM-empowered AI systems
* Provably secure/robust machine learning systems
